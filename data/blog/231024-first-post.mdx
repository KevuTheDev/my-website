I want to write more.

In university, I didn't have many opportunities to write.
I finished a Bachelor's of Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier Univeristy, in Waterloo, Canada.
Through out my Computer Science program, there were not many opportunities for me to write.
I didn't have any assignments to write essays
