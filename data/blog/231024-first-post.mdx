I want to write more.

In university, I donâ€™t have many opportunities to write.
I finished a Bachelor's of Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University, in Waterloo, Canada.
Throughout my Computer Science program, there were not many opportunities for me to write.

My goal in writing on this blog site is to talk about projects I am working on.
To write about my thought process on projects, brainstorm ideas on how to solve problems in my projects,
and any cool things I discover when working on my projects.

I am excited to start my blog and post here.
