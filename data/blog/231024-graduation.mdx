On October 13th 2023, I had the opportunity to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Wilfrid Laurier University.
It was an amazing experience. I learnt so much from my time there. I met so many people during my years of study at the university.
I have faced many challenges when I was studying university and even before university.

In the year 2017, I was in my senior year of high school.
Students and classmates around me are proudly applying for post-secondary but I was still questioning what and where I want to take my future.
I didn't have much self confidence. I didn't achieve top grades in my class. I didn't apply to the universities I want to get into. I applied to universities that accepted students who had mediocre grades.
I did got accepted to those universities, but I didn't accept their offers.

I graduated in high school that year. But I took a gap year. I saw all my friends going to university, enjoying their time. And I felt like I was falling behind.
